<h1>Agent</h1>
<p>
  An agent is an institution-driven entity in the system who must take roles to be able to perform tasks in a given system.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Properties: The case relevant attributes of the person represented as an agent. </li>
  <li>Personal Values: The intentions of an agent which determine his decision making behaviour. </li>
  <li>Information: The information available to an agent. </li>
  <li>Physical components: Similar to information, agents can also possess physical components. </li>
  <li>Possible Roles: The roles that the agent has the potential of taking. An agent must take a role to take part in the system. </li>
  <li>Intrinsic Capabilities: The capabilities an agent has independent of the role he is taking. All the actions taking place in the system should be reflected as an intrinsic capability of an agent, an institutional capability of a role or a behaviour of a physical component. </li>
  <li>Decision Making Criteria: The criteria that the agent uses to choose between a set of options. Decisions are related to actions in the action situation described later</li>
</ul>
