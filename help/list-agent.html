<h1>Agent</h1>
<p>
  An agent (agent type) is an institution-driven entity in the system who must take roles to be able to perform tasks in a given system.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Properties: The relevant attributes (e.g. age, gender, amount of money) of the entity represented as an agent. </li>
  <li>Personal Values: The intentions of an agent (e.g. safety, happiness) which influence his decision making behaviour. </li>
  <li>Information: The information available to an agent (e.g., market price for gold, neighbours identity). This is equivalent to the beliefs of an agent in the BDI architecture. </li>
  <li>Physical components: Similar to information, agents can also possess physical components (e.g. car, computer). </li>
  <li>Possible Roles: The roles that the agent has the potential of taking. Agents take  roles to act in the system. </li>
  <li>Intrinsic Behaviours: The behaviours an agent has independent of the role he is taking (sleeping, talking). All the actions taking place in the system should be reflected as an intrinsic capability of an agent, an institutional responsibility of a role or a behaviour of a physical component. </li>
  <li>Decision Making Criteria: The criteria that the agent uses to decide to perform an action. Decisions are related to entity actions.</li>
</ul>
