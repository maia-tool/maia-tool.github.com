<h1>Evaluative Structure</h1>
<p>The Evaluative Structure provides concepts with the help of which the modeller can indicate what patterns of interaction, evaluation, and outcomes she is interested in. In other words, the modeller should be able to identify those variables that can serve as indicators for model validity (is it sufficiently realistic?) and model usability (will its implementation help me to explore the question(s) I set out to address?). 
</p>

<h1>Validation Variables</h1>
<p>
To make sure that the model implementation answers the questions we want to explore, validation variables are defined.
These variables can be related to independent variables that help monitor them. 
A calculation method shows how a dependent variable can be calculated from the data and variables available as a result of running the simulation.
