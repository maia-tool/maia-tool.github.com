  Physical Structure

<p>
 The physical structure consists of any type of entity that has a physical representation in the system.

  Please use the panels above to enter the physical resources of the system.

<h1>Physical Component</h1>
<p>
  A physical component in the system is an entity that can be used/produced by different agents in the system or constraint their behaviour. A physical component may be assigned to an agent through the role he is taking or may also belong to an agent independent of his role(s). For example, in a given setting, we may define the human body as a physical component belonging to an agent.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Property: Each physical component may have properties</li>
  <li>Behaviour: A physical component can have certain behaviours such as ageing.</li>
  <li>Type: A component can be either open or fenced. If a property is fenced the access is restricted to those agents that have the right. Open components can also have rules that define how and when an agent can use a resource.The difference between these two types of components is most useful when defining layouts and locations for agent models. </li>
</ul>
