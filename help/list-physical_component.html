  Physical Structure
</h1>
<p>
 The physical structure consists of any type of entity that has a physical representation in the system, the composition of these physical entities and their connections. 
</p>


<h1>Physical Component</h1>
<p>
  A physical component in the system is an entity that may influence agent behaviour in the system. 
  A physical component may be assigned to an agent through the role he is taking or may also belong to an agent independent of his role(s). 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Property: Each physical component may have properties.</li>
  <li>Type: A component can be either open or fenced. If a property is fenced the access is restricted to those agents that have the right. Open components can also have rules that define how and when an agent can use a resource.The difference between these two types of components 
  is most useful when defining layouts and locations for agent models. </li>
  <li>Behaviour: A physical component can have certain behaviours such as ageing.</li>
    <li>Affordance: Actions can be done to a physical component, e.g. an apple can be eaten.</li>
</ul>
