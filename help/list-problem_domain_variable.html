<h1>
  Evaluative Structure
</h1>
<p>
  The Evaluative Structure provides concepts with the help of which the modeller can indicate what patterns of 
  interaction, evaluation, and outcomes she is interested in. 
  In other words, the modeller should be able to identify those variables 
  that can serve as indicators for model validity (is it sufficiently realistic?) and 
  model usability (will its implementation help me to explore the question(s) I set out to address?). </p>

<h1>Problem Domain Variables</h1>
To make sure that the model implementation does not violate real-world conditions, 
problem domain variables are defined. These variables can be related to independent variables that help
monitor them. A calculation method shows how a dependent variable can be calculated from the data and variables available as a result of
running the simulation.
