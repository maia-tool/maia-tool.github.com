  Evaluative Structure
</h1>
<p>
  This structure deals with the parameters that are to the emergent outcomes of a system. These parameters can be used for model validation (i.e. having built the right model) and also, to answer the questions that the agent-based model should have answers for.

<h1>Validation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Validation parameter : The parameters that can be used to check the validity of the model or in other words, to check whether the model is behaving the way it should. </li>
  <li>Action situation: The action situation that is related to the validation parameter. </li>
</ul>
