  Evaluative Structure

  This structure deals with the parameters that are to the emergent outcomes of a system. These parameters can be used for model validation (i.e. having built the right model) and also, to answer the questions that the agent-based model should have answers for.

<h1>Validation Matrix</h1>
This matrix specifies the relationship between the validation variables and the entity actions that are specified in the
operational structure. If there is a relationship between a variable and an entity action, it can be direct or indirect.
