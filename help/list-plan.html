<h1>Operational structure</h1>
<p>
  The operational structure makes use of the concepts in the physical, constitutional and collective structures to provide the dynamics of the agent-based model.
</p>

<h1>Action Situation</h1>
<p>
  The action situation component defines the overall operational procedure of the system. Each action situation is the placeholder for a set of related actions. Each action contains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Precondition</li>
  <li>Action body: The intrinsic capability of an agent, the institutional capability part of the role definition, or a physical component behaviour can all be considered as the actions of an action situation. It is the creativity of the modeller to groups related actions into relatively independent actions situations. In other words, the actions in an action situation are more coupled that the actions across multiple action situations. The decision about choosing a particular event as an action situation or only one action as part of an action situation highly depends on the level of detail we are planning to give to the agent-based model. If one action is big enough to be decomposed into many individual actions, it might be considered as an action situation.However, for a given action situation, more than one agent is involved even if they are taking the same role. </li>
  <li>Physical Component: In action situation some physical components may be present. </li>
  <li>Institutional Statement: Institutional statements usually hold in certain situations. The agents follow the statements if they are taking specific roles. </li>
</ul>
