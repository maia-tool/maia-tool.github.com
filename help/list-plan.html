<h1>Operational structure</h1>
<p>
  The operational structure makes use of the concepts in the physical, constitutional and collective structures to provide the dynamics of the agent-based model.
   Each simulation has exactly one action arena that is defined by a list of action situations, where each action situation describes the order in which a number of related entity actions take place using plan specifications.
</p>

<h1>Plans</h1>
<p>
   There are four different types of plans:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>atomic plan: consists of a single entity action  (e.g., become unit boss). </li>
  <li>sequence plan: consists of a set of plans that will be executed in the specified order (e.g., select employee, hire employee).  </li>
  <li>alternative plan: consists of a set of plans form which one is selected randomly (with equal probability). </li>
  <li>loop: consists of a plan that is repeated for as long as a condition holds (e.g., process old computers until there is none left). </li>
</ul>
