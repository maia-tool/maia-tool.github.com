  Constitutional structure
</h1>
<p>
  The constitutional structure covers the social concepts of a system. This structure defines roles, institutions, and role dependencies.
</p>

<h1>Institutional Statement</h1>
<p>
  Institutional statements are presented as ADICO sequences.  An ADICO sequence consists of 5 components: Attributes, Deontic, aIm, Condition and Or else. Following this structure, there are three different types of institutional statements. If there is no `Or else' for an ADICO statement, it is considered as a norm. In other words, if an agent does not follow a norm, he may receive different reactions but there is not explicit unique sanction. A `shared strategy' is a type of institutional statement where there are no deontic type or sanctions. Agents follow institutional statements depending on the roles they are taking.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attribute: The roles that would be using this institution as part of their definition. </li>
  <li>Deontic type: An institution can be in the form of prohibition, obligation or permission.</li>
  <li>aIm : The goal of the institution which may be in the form of action or outcome. If in the form of action, the aim of an institutional statement should be defined as a capability of the roles that the statement is a part of ( i.e. the attributes of the statement). The aim can also be presented an an expected outcome. The aim does not include description of when and where the action is conducted. </li>
  <li>Condition: The condition for the institution to hold which may address when and where the aim should take place. The when maybe temporal or in relation to some other concept. </li>
  <li>Or else: The sanction for the agent taking the role if he does not follow the institution. Agents can decide to follow rules or disobey them based on their own preferences and decision making behaviour. </li>
  <li>Institutional type: Type can be formal (laws and regulations, written) or informal (not written ). </li>
</ul>
