<h1>Operational structure</h1>
<p>
  The operational structure makes use of the concepts in the physical, constitutional and collective structures to provide the dynamics of the agent-based model.
Each simulation has exactly one action arena that is defined by a list of action situations, where each action situation describes the order in which a number of related entity actions take place using plan specifications.</p>
<h1>Entity Actions</h1>
<p>
Each entity action has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Performer: The performer of the action which can be an agent type, a role type or a physical component type. </li>
  <li>Action Body: The action body which is the actual event that takes place. It is either the intrinsic behaviour of an agent, institutional responsibility of a role, or a behaviour of a physical component. </li>
  <li>Decision making: The decision making process that may happen during the execution of the entity action. </li>
  <li>Precondition: The preconditions that need to hold before performing the entity action. </li>
  <li>Postcondition: The consequences of performing the action which result in the update in the status of the system (e.g. money = money +1) </li>
  <li>Postcondition Not Do: The consequences of not performing the action.</li>
</ul>
