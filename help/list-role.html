  Constitutional structure
</h1>
<p>
  The constitutional structure covers the social concepts of a system. This structure defines roles, institutions, and role dependencies.
</p>

<h1>Role</h1>
<p>
  A role is an abstract representation of a set of activities that take place according to some rules in order to reach social objectives. Agents which are defined separately in the collective structure, can take roles. Agents taking a certain role may behave differently according to their internal agent attributes (e.g. personal values). It is possible for an agent to take more than one role be it simultaneously or sequentially.
  A role has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objective: The general result of a role. Agents communicate with each other based on their role objectives. The emergent interactions in the model are not necessarily consistent with the objectives of the roles. If the attributes of an agent such as his internal interests are not in line with the objectives of a role, objective inconsistencies in interactions may occur. </li>
  <li>Institutional Statement: The set of rules that apply to this role (will be explained in the institution section).</li>
  <li>Entry Condition: The set of conditions under which an agent can take a role. These conditions define how an agent can switch between roles or have multiple roles at the same time. </li>
  <li>Institutional Responsibility (or Capability): The functions that become available to an agent when taking a certain role. </li>
</ul>
